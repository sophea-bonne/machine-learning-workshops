A repository storing the various ML projects solved from Dr. Paul Grigas at UC Berkeley

1. Linear Regression with VIF's and p-values
2. Logistic Regression with confusion matrix
3. Models: CART, vanilla bagging, random forests, cross validation

4. NLTK, tokenization, stop words, stemming, document-term matrix. Models: gradient boosted classifiers, linear discriminant analysis, bootstrapping random forests

5. Cross-validation to find best number of archetypal users.
